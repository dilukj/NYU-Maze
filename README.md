# Office Maze VR Experience
 
A prototype game where the player has to find the exit of the office environment. During the gameplay, the player has to find a key to enter into the main office room which will lead to the exit door of the office. Before reaching to the exit door, the player has to grab a USB flash drive to win the game.

Asset Used: Snaps office 3D prototyping and connector package from the Unity Store. The connector package contains the USB flashdrive prefab.

Packages Used: Progrids, Probuilder, XR Interaction Toolkit, XR Plugin Management, Open XR plugin, Oculus XR plugin, Unity Input Systems.

Challenges: I used the latest XR interaction toolkit where the development experience somewhat different to the video materials shared in the course. The starter assets contain input actions and presets which helped me to fasttrack the configuration of input action manager as well as input system bindings. Had some issues with detecting input controllers and after going through XR plugin management configuraiton in project settings, I was able to bring them to action. 

This is my first VR development experience and I'm glad I could develop a good VR experience after following tutorials. I was able to bring the hand avatars to the gameplay after going through the following week materials. 

Next steps:
- Add more challenges/interactions to the player with a scoring mechanism for game mechanics.
- Lighting of the office environment that resembles a realworld office environment.
- Add more props to the environment.
- Add a corouting to animate the door opening behavior once the player inserts the key.
- Teleport reticle looks somewhat closer to Google Tilt Brush
